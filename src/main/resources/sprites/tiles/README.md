# Tile Sprites

Place environment tile sprites in this folder.

## Required Sprites (64x64 pixels):

### Core Tiles:
- `floor.png` - Floor tile (will be tiled across room)
- `wall.png` - Wall tile (will be tiled for room borders)
- `door.png` - Door sprite (80x50 pixels, will be rotated)

## Sprite Requirements:
- Format: PNG (recommended), JPG, or GIF
- Size: 64x64 pixels (for tiling)
- Should tile seamlessly (edges match)
- Door sprite: 80x50 pixels (horizontal orientation)

## Tiling Behavior:
- Floor and wall sprites are automatically tiled
- Make sure edges connect seamlessly for best appearance
- Use consistent color palette across all tiles

## Tips:
- Test your tiles by placing them side-by-side
- Use a grid-based design for perfect tiling
- Doors should be visually distinct from walls
- Consider adding subtle variations to floor tiles
